## Project setup

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The data generation script requires an input file [data.tsv](https://github.com/profwernstrom/noescape-data/raw/refs/heads/master/data.tsv), which is **not included in this repository** due to its size and frequent updates.

You can download the file and  place it in the following location:

    ./data/data.tsv
